Hello . today i just made a perfect outliner for the Text in gimp
To Use this tool just go to "/Filters/Layer/Duplicate Selected Layer with Alpha Selection, Grow, and Color Fill" After selecting
your layer and the chosen outline color ....
(if you want to change the outline size just go to line24 and change the grow amount)
